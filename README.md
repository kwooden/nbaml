# NBAML Game and Score Predictor

This project is my introduction into Machine Learning(ML) using PHP7 tools.  It also serves as an introduction to Python.  The tool is designed to enable users to create Machine Learning models, then use those models to predict the score of NBA games.  Current the system creates Linear Regression and Neural Network models.  The user can customize the game statistics and number of training games.  The code is pre-beta, I'm still working out all the features and fixing bugs.

## Getting Started

Download the MySQL .sql file and import into your instance of the database.  Download all files and install on your web server.  Verify that Python is loaded and you can run it from command line.  Navigate to the file "nbaml.php" in your browser.
