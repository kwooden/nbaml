# NBAML Game and Score Predictor

This project is my introduction into Machine Learning(ML) using PHP7 tools.  It also serves as an introduction to Python.  The tool is design to allow as user to select two NBA teams and predict the score of there game and who would win using Linear Regression and/or a Neural Network.  The code is pre-beta, I'm still working out all the features.
